"Where is the master who could' have taught Shakespeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is an unique" (Emerson 9)



Emerson says that every great man is unique, and it is that uniqueness that makes them great. Throughout the essay, Emerson writes about staying true to oneself rather than assimilating into the homogeneous blob that is society. This reminds me of a conversation I had with my boss over the summer where he talked about uniqueness and being special. My boss professed that one should always do something different; he chose to relate it to a video game ranking system, where if you are at the middle of the rankings and you do something different you will either go to the highest ranking or the lowest ranking. This goes hand in hand with Emerson's point that greatness stems from being your own self and being true to that. My boss extrapolated this to say that one should always do what they want to do in the most unique way possible, and everything will flow from there, as if he was reading from Emerson.



Why does Emerson keep invoking Christianity in his paper? Is it meant to represent the western European establishment.
