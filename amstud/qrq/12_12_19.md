Regular Question 



Quote: "...now that they had finally mastered human channels of communication, such as speech, they swished to try and make amends." (Le Guin 132)



Claim: People are unable to properly decide to either with the flow or impose their will unless they have the ability to communicate with those their actions will affect. In Le Guin's novel, *The Lathe of Heaven*, she introduces an alien race in one of the 'realities'. In the original reality, before any 'dream intervention' from Orr, the alien's peaceful curiosity of humans is mistaken for a violent conquest. A key difference from the base reality with aliens and the one that the Orr is currently experiencing is the alien's ability to properly communicate with the humans, "...now that they had finally mastered human channels of communication, such as speech, they switched to try and make amends." (Le Guin 132) Having 'mastered' the ability to 'communicate' with humans, the aliens then strategically 'switched' the way they were interacting with humans in order to have a better relationship and 'make amends' with the people on earth. In order to properly gauge whether to wake a conquest and impose their will or peacefully interact and go with the flow, the alien's first had to communicate in order to assess the outcomes to the relevant parties. This is contrasted with Haber's and Orr's imposition of will when they don't understand all the parties it will affect, and still decide to go through with the action. While they do end up choosing between the two options, it is not a properly enough informed decision that can be backed up by reasoning. Thus, in order to decide one has to gather enough information through communicating with the potentially harmed people.
