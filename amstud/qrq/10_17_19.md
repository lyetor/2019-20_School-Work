### The Road 131-175

"When he was done he took the towel from around the boy's shoulders and he scooped the golden hair from the floor and wiped the boy's face and shoulders with a damp cloth and held a mirror for him to see." (152)



Cormac McCarthy uses description to touch on the idea of this boy being pure or special. The author uses the word "golden" to describe the boy's hair, hinting at an almost angelic state. This conjures an image of a servant/helper working to clean off a diving being. McCarthy's repetitive focus on this boy's hair made me connect this to the biblical character Samson. This was a character with long, flowing hair that gave him immense strength and allowed him to create superhuman feats. I think the author hopes to, in a very nuanced way, make the reader recognize that this boy is exceedingly powerful. This also makes me wonder as to whether this is foreshadowing to the boy's hair being cut off, and the boy losing the part of him that makes him so strong.



What was the symbolism/why did the author have the man and the boy find the cellar full of food and goods?
