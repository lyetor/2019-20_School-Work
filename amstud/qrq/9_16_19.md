### Kennan Long Telegram

"To all that, the war has added its tremendous toll of destruction, death and human exhaustion. In consequence of this, we have in Russia today a population which is physically and spiritually tired. The mass of the people are disillusioned, skeptical" (Kennan 9) 



Through anecdotal experience, Kennan argues that the people of the Soviet Union have been trampled on, not only by the war, but by the revolutionary aftermath. Using nuanced, emotionally complicated words such as exhaustion and disillusioned show the author's want to paint the Soviet citizens in the most emotional way possible. It is important to note the audience this is being written for, not only was it written for American intelligence personal, but it was also meant for the general American public. Looking at the audience this was published for, it becomes apparent that Kennan was essentially crying out for help on behalf of the Soviet population. Thus, when US government officials and day to day constituents read this, they most likely felt, to whatever extent, an emotional obligation to help suffering people. This was one of many situations in the 20th century that begged the question of whether or not it was/is the US's job to be the policemen of the world. With the cold war, it would quickly become clear how America chose to answer that.



What is the consensus among historians on what would have been the most stable, long-term solution to the Soviet Union post world war 1?
