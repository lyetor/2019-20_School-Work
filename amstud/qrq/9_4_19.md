### The Creative Process (James Baldwin)

"We know, in the case of the person, that whoever cannot tell himself the truth about his past is trapped in it, is immobilized in the prison of his undiscovered self...We know how a person, in such a paralysis, is unable to asses either his weakness or his strengths, and how frequently indeed he mistakes one for the other." (Baldwin)



James Baldwin postulates that a lack of growth and introspection makes people beholden to their pasts. Baldwin's use of the phrase, "immobilized in the prison", evokes an image of a man in shackles, imprisoned by a power greater than him. This diction, coupled with words like "trapped" and "paralysis" further cement the idea of a person put into chains in the reader's mind. Baldwin uses his carefully painted picture to profess that people not dealing with their internal strife directly causes an inability to separate their strengths from their weaknesses. Baldwin chooses to speak in the negative, explaining the downfalls of men, thereby alluding to the fix for this problem, properly dealing with one's past. Baldwin uses the evocative diction image of an icy jail to help the reader understand his more complicated point.



How does Baldwin propose that people go about reconciling the internal war between one's current self and imagined self?
