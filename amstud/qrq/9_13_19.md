### Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God

"However you may have reformed your life in many things, and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of religion in your families in closets, and in the house of God, it is nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment swallowed up in everlasting destruction." (2)



Regardless of the way one carries themselves or functions in the world, their fate rests in the hands of this, preached to be, benevolent God. Throughout the paper the author argues that the only thing keeping the human race alive is the "pleasure" that He gains from it. This specific quote ideates that whether or not one chooses to follow the path of God and preach His word, we are all still at the mercy of his wrath. When comparing this to Emerson, who romanticizes both people and the divine, a stark contrast becomes extremely apparent. Seeing as the author argues that what is done in one's lifetime has no bearing on God's view on them, I think it is safe to assume that this author does not care what a person does in their life. Thus, in almost polar opposite to Emerson, this paper professes that one doesn't need to act with morals and trying to repent their sins is futile.



Why does this differ from traditional Christianity where one can repent their sins and go to Heaven?
