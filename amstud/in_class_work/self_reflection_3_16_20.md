### Spring Cleaning:  Get Your Mind Right 

 

**Assignment:**  You did some really nice work reflecting on your work and participation in the literary trial.  As we begin Spring trimester, ponder the big picture. We’ve only got a few months left, so decide what you want to get out of the experience, and then decide what’s going to get you there.  Respond to the following questions and upload to Schoology by the end of class today.

 

1. **Consider where you were in September.  Where have you made the most progress? What has helped you get there?**

   Wow, just reading the question and thinking about this is crazy. I find myself to be a pretty introspective person, but to pick and prod all of the skills that I've learned from Amstud in the past 6 months is going to take a while. Starting with deltas that are pretty easily detectable, I have to go with my history tests. I've increased my history scores across the tests we've taken and have scored pretty high in the class and this is all considering that I had never taken a history test prior to this course. Next, I think I've made great strides in both my analytical writing that is showcased in history and in my subjective, personal writing for English. Alongside these harder, more technical skills, I also find myself having cultivated a lot of soft skills. These include better communication and an increased ability to articulate ideas. I picked up more teamwork skills on the Literary Trial project. While this is the are that I still need the most work on, I think i have definitely improved my exploratory thinking skills. I think this idea of exploratory thinking is where I have seen the largest delta in my life outside of the classroom. I find that the way we approach questions in American Studies has positively impacted my ability to engage in dinner table conversation. Alongside this, our work with philosophers has made me a swiss army knife at the dinner table of an Indian family friend whether it's talking about STEM or throwing out a philosopher's main idea, thanks to this course. 

2. **What are you struggling with at this point?  Is it time management? Participation? Some area of your reading or writing?  Be precise and identify the sticking point. What’s your plan to make some progress here?**

   As I mentioned above, I think the thing that I consistently struggle with the most is my ability to transition from "debate" thinking to the exploratory thinking that we practice throughout the trimester in discussions and other activities. In reflecting with Lisa after the trial, I found that I often try to clarify content when answering Lisa and Brian's 'spicy' questions instead of delving into new depths and trying to incorporate new ideas. I also found I was met with this same issue during Kobayashi, and coming fresh off the debate circuit for both of them was no help. 

   On history, I've spent the majority of time this year making my writing more concise and trying to cut out filler. I still feel that this is a place where I can cut down. I often times lose sight of what each piece of the paragraph or essay is trying to convey and add extraneous information, that isn't necessarily bad or wrong, it's just the wrong time or place. Specifically, I need to cut out filler before and after quotes in order to make my analysis smooth and cogent. 

   While this isn't a technical skill I struggle with, I find that I have a hard time starting work for this course as compared to other classes. Something about each of the assignments feels very high stakes, and I always become over anxious when I'm planning out my homework and often leave this work to the end. At times during Winter tri I was doing a better job of "gutta cavat lapidem" as Brian says, but I still have a lot of work to do on chipping away at stuff prior to the deadline. 

3. **Make a measurable goal for our last trimester.  “Be better at participation/ essays/ rollerblading” is not measurable.  A good goal is one that you can KNOW you’ve achieved through a reasonable metric.  “Participate twice in each discussion” is measurable, and you can easily tell if you’ve achieved it.**  

   On the first point, I'm going to limit myself to talking twice every class discussion. Along with this, I will purposefully try to not rephrase anything that has been said, rather waiting for an opportunity to add new content or a fresh perspective. I think this will do a few main things. I think only being able to talk twice will force me to save my two interjections for times where I actually have something new to add. I also think it will give my classmates more space to explain their ideas, something I struggled with on the trial. Lastly, it will also cultivate more of my listening skills. I don't know how this will function given the virtual environment, but I will still do my best.

   In terms of the chunking out the work, I hope to have most all homework assignments done, or at least started on the day before they are due. This will also be reflected in the fact that I will make 2 revisions on my English essays this tri, rather than just 1. Lastly, I will also schedule history writing conferences in between CRP deadlines in order to make sure that I am chipping away at such a massive task. 

4. **How can we help you get there?**

   Well isn't that the million dollar question. I think you guys have done a great job so far this year from entertaining my questions after class to giving insightful feedback during our conferences. I just hope that you guys will keep doing what you're doing and that you are able to see the benefit I get from those quick conversations after class. I hope to meet with you guys more than I have over the year, but I understand that this is my obligation rather than yours. 

   I don't know how this will function in a remote environment, but even just being there while we're doing our exit tickets is nice. For instance, Brian, Will, Zubin, and I had a nice "after class" discussion after our TEWWG discussion. 

   Also, I love writing reflections so much if y'all can't already tell.
