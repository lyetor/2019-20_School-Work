My name is Micheal Bookman, and I'm the new president's Chief of Staff. Before Reagan died, he had two Chiefs of Staff, James Baker and Donald Regan, both of whom I look up to, Regan more so than Baker. The duties I tackle head on everyday are different than the ones that each of my predecessors has done. On a day to day basis I usually help the President get between meetings, manage the flow of people into his office, make sure only the necessary information is getting to him, and and supervise specific White House staff. Essentially I am the gatekeeper to the President who does the grunt work to make sure the White House doesn't fall into a disarray of chaos.

I was born in Montgomery, Alabama as the last in a line of seven children. I grew up needing to constantly prove myself in the classroom, on the sports field, and at the dining table. My parents were never anything special. although they sure did love me a hell of a lot. After graduating college on a full-ride scholarship I knew I wanted to get into something political and create change for people, something I never got to do as a kid. I worked in the House of Representatives until I was appointed by the new President after Regan's death. This was a guy who I had met at college, and had instantly hit it off, which ended up paying off.

Although I don't have any "direct" political power it's not too hard to influence what's going on around the White House. I hope to continue Regan's legacy of supporting trickle-down economics through tax breaks for the richer and bigger businesses. Moreover, in terms of foreign policy, I have a pretty similar perspective as everyone else in the White House. I trust everyone to do their job specifically, but am hopeful to add my own personal flavor to it. Let's see what I can do at my new post!
