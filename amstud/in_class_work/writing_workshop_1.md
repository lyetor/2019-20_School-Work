I inhaled the smell of freshly cut grass  as I sat down in the park. My jeans would most likely be tinted green by the time I got up. I saw a cockroach moseying along in front of me. I imagined what that little guy had been through. It was completely feasible that this little insect had been alive for the past year, which was coincidentally the last time I had been to this park. 

My prior experience here was quite a found memory. A similar smell of grass, but that time it was combined with the smell of the world after a thunderstorm. I had been on a picnic at the time. The sides of my lips curled up in a smile. My stomach bubbled, longing to be in that moment again. I missed the tingling in your fingertips that was a combined product of liquor and soft, heartfelt conversation. I could feel my heart trying to reach out of my chest. Not out of spite for the present, but rather due to the positive nature of my last time here.

I wasn't in pain, though. I had a feeling of reconciliation that I was here now, but my memory of the past was similar to one's first memory of ice cream or cake. As the feeling of happiness bubbled up inside of me, my eyes started to water a little bit. I could feel my face get warmer. I was sitting there, grinning like an idiot, remembering a past life filled with joy, and wondered whether or not that little cockroach, Melvin I decided, was doing the same thing.
