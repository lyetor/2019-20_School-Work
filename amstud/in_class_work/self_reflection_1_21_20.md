### Winter Mid-Term Self Reflection



1. At the end of Fall trimester, we asked you to set a goal.  How did that turn out?  Did you follow through on your plan?  Make a new goal, now that we’re at the halfway point in the year.  Again, you need a plan.  How are you going to get there?

My goal was to improve my writing skills, specifically my QRQs. I think I have worked hard to pay more attention to my QRQs, and have chatted with Lisa about how to improve my QRQs. Often when I'm writing them I'll have a mental checklist of things I should and shouldn't do, and I think that has made my QRQs improve a lot. Sometimes I'll read through some of my older QRQs and I feel like I've made very noticeable strides in diction analysis, being cogent, and making sure to stick with one, simpler topic. The introduction of EQs made writing responses far easier for me, because of the structure that they fit into, and I think I do these well. Writing EQs has also given me a better structure and mental framing with which to think about the QRQs.

History writing. While I feel I am improving at my subjective, personal writing, and my writing responses, I think that my history writing has room to improve. I do think of myself as being much better at objective writing about fact, I think I have often been able to skate by on following the structure of paragraphs very precisely. I think objective, analytical writing is one of those things that people thing is very easy, so they don't work very hard to get good at it. While it does seem simpler, and easier, I think there are people who do a seemingly simple task exceedingly well and I want to become one of them. I'm going to achieve this by doing a similar thing to what I did last tri with my writing, meeting with the teachers and carefully applying the information they give me. I also think I need to move my frame of mind to seeing analytical writing as a task to a practice of challenging skills. 

Procrastination. 9 times out of 10 I wait until the night before an assignment is due and finish it then, or I actually do the homework in the morning. I want to prioritize time management and fixing this, considering my schedule is going to be much more free without frisbee or debate. 

  

2. Time to reflect on what’s working in your life as a writer and reviser.  What is one thing that has made your life easier in the drafting and revision process with your papers?  What is one thing that you’re still struggling with during the drafting or revision process?  How do you plan on addressing this struggle?

The two thinks that I have done well at are pre-writing and re-writing. I truly detest the idea of writing an assignment without prewriting on it or thinking about it. I always do my best to do readings as early as possible and brainstorm ideas for essays early in order to give myself time to prewrite and let the idea form in my head. Once I have the idea in my head and sentence fragments I then sit down to write, and I'm far less self conscious and I write so much quicker. I also firmly believe writing is actually the process of revising, and this doesn't just mean throwing in a few commas and calling it a day. I feel I am decent at revising things, but that is something I want to work on. My biggest struggle is actually the inability to let go of work that I have done. Moving forward, when revising I won't actually have my old copy of the paper up. Instead I'll take the ideas that each section symbolized, pick what part I need to keep, and then add whatever it is lacking. This will definitely help me from just re-writing the same things. I think properly stripping down the essay to the bare parts that I need will be useful.   

3. How are things going on the History side?  Do you have a functional process for keeping up with the readings and terms?  What do you want to maintain or change?

The first thing I learned this tri was that missing history class is really, really tough. Part of this is because something about being in the lecture space with images and a voice telling you what the answer is, is very helpful. It is also very nice to learn information throughout the year and let is simmer in your head for a while and have your brain synthesize it. 

If I continue missing class I think it would be smart to catch up on history there and then, instead of waiting until the end of the tri to learn it. Along with this, even if I'm not missing class I think it would be nice to create my terms list throughout the term instead of waiting till a few days before. 


4. Brag a little bit.  What’s something you’ve learned or done that you’re really proud of?  It might not be something we saw in class- fill us in.

I feel very good about my last personal essay revision for the significant person. I also feel very good about how much I've reflected on the KM speech and how much that has impacted my debate chops and just general life perspective. I am proud of how I contribute to class with meaningful things, and also have gotten quite good at making space for other people. 




5. Anything else we should know?   

I'm having a great year! I know people often complain about the workload of the class, but I find it near perfect for me. It's hard and challenging, but to the perfect extent. It is really hard to push myself to keep working and doing everything to the best of my ability, but it is the perfect level of feels just out of reach but still doable. I'm enjoying the class and love the intellectual stimulation we get every day.
