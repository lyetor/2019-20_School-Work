### Fall Mid-Term Self Reflection 

A: Exceeds expectations consistently.  I always go above and beyond in this category.

B: Meets expectations consistently.  I usually meet the expectations set, though I don't always exceed them.

C: Working to achieve expectations consistently.  Sometimes I'm getting it, and sometimes it's a work in progress.

D: Not yet meeting expectations.  This is an area I am actively seeking to improve.





Please give yourself a grade in the following areas.  Be honest, and think about what we've done since the beginning of the year.   Including commentary for why you have earned this grade is helpful.

 

Preparedness (all readings complete on time with annotations; QRQ submitted on time, all necessary materials brought to class )

GRADE: A-

REASON: I think I've earned this grade through consistently meeting expectations and at times exceeding them. In class I always have my necessary materials for that day, and am prepared to take notes on whatever we do. I complete all of my homework on time to a level where I'm proud of my assignments. While all this is just meeting expectations, on some of the assignments I'll do additional research into the topic if it is a history document. Or if it is a philosopher I'll read a bit about them and see who they're compared to. So I think I'm always meeting expectations, but sometimes make the decision to go above and beyond. 

 

Participation in Discussion (prepared to discuss, enthusiastic contributions, listens, gives others space to talk)

GRADE: A- 

REASON: I think I've earned this grade through being prepared, making meaningful contributions, and making sure to not share to much. I always feel that I'm ready to make an insightful contribution to the discussion regardless of the part of the discussion that we're in. I feel that the way I complete my homework allows me to be prepared for class. I keep a tally of how many times I have spoken and have always tried to keep that number as low as possible, usually around 2 or 3, thus allowing others to share their mind. I try and ask questions and incorporate other people into the discussion. But, I still have a lot of room for improvement and think I can manage to be an even better participator. 

 

Behavioral Choices (sit away from distracting friends, focus on work, appropriate use of phones and laptops):

GRADE: B+

REASON: I think that I consistently meet expectations in this category, but don't exceed expectations. I sit away from the people I'm friends with, listen to the teacher without engaging in side conversation, and don't use technology at inappropriate times or an inappropriate ways. While all of this is meeting expectations, I think exceeding expectations would be reminded your classmates to follow suite and helping them to do so, something I don't/have yet to do. 

 

 



**Brief Reflections**

Respond to each prompt with 3-6 sentences.  Be specific.  This will help you think about ways you have been successful and set some goals for the rest of the year.

 

1. What are you currently doing to be a good community member?  Do you contribute to discussion?  Do you encourage others, or help your colleagues study?  Think about the ways you contribute to the class community, and write down your thoughts.  Is there an area you’d like to improve?

   I contribute to discussion in meaningful ways adding my personal perspective or trying to bring up unique points rather than reiterating something that has already been said. During the clump discussions I feel that I help my peers understand parts  if they are confused, and vice versa. Outside the classroom I encourage others to study and give them the same resources I'm working or have created with so that they can do a better job. I also talk about the class and what we're learning outside of class to help me and my peers gain a better understanding of the topics at hand. I think I could improve this by making an effort to physically study with people or help organize study groups. 

 

2. Set a goal.  What’s one area you’d really like to improve on this trimester? Be specific in what you’d like to work on.  What can we do to help you get there?

   I would like to get better at writing QRQs and other subjective writing. I feel comfortable in my studying skills for history and vocab quizzes, my ability to gain history information, and participation in discussion. But, sometimes when I'm submitting QRQs I will be unsure of how well I am going to do, a similar feeling I had with the personal essay. Other times, I will feel extremely confident about the QRQ I wrote, and hope to re-create that feeling every time. Usually I write QRQs in about 20-25 minutes, my goal will be to stretch this time to about 35-40 minutes and focus on picking out better diction and editing more thoroughly. After I get comments back, I will also try and engage in conversation with my teachers to see how I can go about improving. Through the improvement of my QRQs and working on smaller writing skills, I think that I will be more confident and a better writer for the larger personal essays.

 

3. What’s one thing you've done thus far that you're proud of?  Why were you happy with it?

   Although we haven't gotten our grades back and I'm unsure of how I did, I'm happy with the way I studied for our history mid-term. Having never taken a history exam in my life, I was extremely stressed coming into this school year, and was almost certain that I would be failing in the history curriculum. Between being really attentive in class and taking good notes and talking with past amstud students and my peers I developed strategies to study for the test. I put a good amount of time and effort into studying and felt pretty confident and not nearly as much anxiety from the beginning of the year while I took the test. Thus I'm proud of myself for seeing a gap in my learning, and instead of accepting it, working hard to pay more attention, doing outside research, and figuring out ways to do well. 

 

4. What reading have you most enjoyed thus far?  (Could be History or English...look at your back catalog of QRQs if you've forgotten!)  What did you like about it?

   I think my favorite reading so far has been Brown v Board of Education (1954). I've always been interested in court cases and legal things and found it very fascinating to read an actual court case. I also find racial discrimination to be something I'm very passionate about, and this was the intersection of the two, while also being a part of a larger historical landscape that I was very keen on learning about. Not only was it nice to read, thinking about what I'd write my QRQ on was a very fun exercise. I talked with my friends about it, and decided to go against the grain because there were a couple of passages that struck me the wrong way, seeing as the author was a white man in the 50s.
