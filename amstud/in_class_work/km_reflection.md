### KM Speech Reflection

**Part I:  Reflection**

1. What did you do to prepare for your speech?  What did you do alone?  How did you use your group time?  Were any of these things particularly effective?  What would you do differently next time?

I spent most of my time preparing for the speech just talking to people about it. When I had solo work time to improve my speech I tried to find someone to either text or facetime with to just talk about the framework with. I think this was extremely effective for me. I was able to beat my ideas into shape as I talked to more and more people with different perspectives. Every time I talked to someone they would ask me questions that I usually hadn't heard before. I used the group time in a very similar way, just discussing frameworks with them and having them ask my questions about it. The actual practice of talking with someone about the framework let me see where the biggest holes were and what I was going to get grilled on the most, and try and think of solutions to fill those gaps. I don't really feel like I lacked anything during my prep. I felt like I used my time effectively to properly prepare me for the speech. 

 

2. In your own mind, how did your performance go?  Did you feel like you articulated your ideas clearly?  Did you feel comfortable considering questions?  What was the strongest part of your performance?  Were you able to demonstrate intellectual flexibility, incorporating new information into your schema?

I thought I did very poorly compared to what I was hoping to do. I don't say that as if I got a sub par grade that I wasn't satisfied with, and was left unhappy with myself. Rather, as soon as I sat down I knew exactly what I should have changed and that I didn't live up to the pretty high standards that I had set myself. This is something that happens a lot in debate rounds, where when giving a speech one often glazes over things that they had hoped to mention or gives an incoherent response and immediately after the round this person realizes the exact perfect thing they could've said to completely dismantle their opponents argument. This feeling is similar to when you don't finish a problem on a math test and after walking out of the room you immediately remember the correct formula to approach the problem with. I feel like I didn't articulate my ideas as clearly as I would have wanted. I felt somewhat comfortable answering the questions, and I knew the exact questions that were going to be asked, I just got a little bit mentally flustered. I feel that the strongest part of my performance were the images that I used to convey my points, especially the opening and closing images. I didn't demonstrated enough intellectual flexibility as I would've liked. Every day after my speech I've thought about the exact words that I should have said that would have properly demonstrated changing my perspective and evolving my framework, and feel bad that I didn't say those things when I was up there giving my speech. 

 

3. Look at all the bits of feedback you received.  Do you see any themes emerging? What do they suggest you did well, and what do they suggest you should work on?

I did well on the images that I presented and helped the audience understand what was going on through good metaphors and analogy. Where I failed to do as well was applying my thinking to historical examples, specifically how to solve for systemic issues that came from other immoral actions. 

 

**Part II:  Plotting, Scheming, Goal Setting**

1.  Set an intellectual goal for yourself.  Where would you like to see yourself and your ideas by the end of this trimester?  

I would like to be able to think critically in time pressured situations. I see myself as having built up a good set of critical thinking skills, and feel that I am able to tackle a problem given to me if I have enough time. But this project really showed me my inability to think critically in a very short time span. 

 

2. Set a speaking goal for yourself.   What would you like to be able to do at the end of the trimester?

I would like to be able to speak without putting my hands in my pockets or shifting my feet in a strained manner. I believe there are body movements and things to do with your legs that project confidence, but instead the shifting of feet I do looks nervous. I have also gotten into the habit of putting my hands into my pockets during debate rounds when I'm speaking, which inadvertently happened in the speech, and is something I'm hoping to work on. I think my voice and tone modulation is at a good place, it is the body movements I struggle with more because I have not practiced those in debate. 

 

3. How, exactly, are you going to make this happen?  What practice or procedures are going to get you to those goals?

I think that debate is a very good venue to work on these goals, if I'm purposeful with my time. Just doing more debate rounds won't help me become a better speaker or thinker in the specific areas that I'm working on, unless I approach it with a growth mindset. I will practice standing still during debate speeches and keeping my hands out of my pockets. I will also engage in as many debate conversations inside and outside the round which will work to improve the muscle of critical thinking in timed situations. I also believe that instead of having a conversation which ends on "let me think about that", I can practice trying to do the critical thinking during the conversation and continuing on.
