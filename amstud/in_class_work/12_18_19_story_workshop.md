"Ho. Ho. Ho," I said in the darkness

* He's sitting in the close thinking to himself when the family notices him 
* He then holds the closet door even tighter and tells them to not try and open the door 
* He then thinks if he pretends to be Santa that the family will think he's Santa and decide to leave him alone until 

I sat inside the dark wooden closet, reveling in the warmth of the heated house it was in. My fingers had already been warm for a while, but my toes started to unfreeze. I heard footsteps coming this way again, the people in the house didn't come to this part of the house very often. Judging by what was inside it, the family didn't use this closet often. There were just a few tattered up coats that didn't look like they'd seen any action in a few years. I moved my head to look at the trashbag at my feet, carefully squinting I managed to see it. Now those old coats would be put to use when I was back out in the cold again. 

As the footsteps got closer, I reached outside the closet and pulled the door shut as quietly as possible. I gripped the shiny and smooth wooden door with my 4 fingers in the hope that I wouldn't be betrayed by the creaking door accidentally swinging out. A little girl started to talk, "Mom!!! I can't find my old jacket and hat. I've looked everywhere in the house. Where do you think they could be?" Shit, I thought to myself. She hadn't actually checked the whole house, because the closet I was in had remained closed for the past couple of days. 

"Are you sure you checked everywhere? Even the downstairs closet? Because that's where you usually forget to check," an older female voiced shrilly screeched, filling the whole house. Downstairs closet? I was pretty sure that that was the place that I had lived in for the past few days. I mean it easily beat lying outside in the cold, and did these rich people really need all of this space? The light footsteps, which could've only come from a very small human, got closer to my little mahogany alcove. I thought about the contents of the bag that I had stolen to get me through the winter, all stuff too small for me, and realized that little girl's hat and jacket was most likely in the garbage bag next to my feet. 

I wondered what she'd think if she managed to open the door and say an unkempt guy, with a white beard, gray hair, and a big bag of random clothes he'd acquired. Still pulling on the door, I stood up and swung the bag over my head as I realized there was only one possible way to get out of this without getting arrested or shot. I felt some resistance on my hand holding the door shut and a tiny grunt come from the currently invisible girl's little body. In a last ditch effort I shouted the one thing that sprung to mind that would make this situation look okay, "Ho, Ho, Ho!"

* Bargaining with the family to try and let him stay for Christmas because it's cold outside
* The family, especially the mom, keeps on threatening to call the police if he doesn't get out 
* He breaks down crying and talks about how he has nowhere to go, and hasn't had a proper Christmas meal in years '

"Woah! It's Santee Clause," the little girl said in an excited voice. "Wait, but aren't you early?" she queried in a high pitch. 

"How did you know? It is I, Santa, here to bring the presents," I said in a very choppy fashion. I continued my explanation of the situation, "Well I always wait at the house of the kids who are getting the most presents."

"No way! That's awe-some." The girl exclaimed, as she realized that meant she was getting extra presents this year. "I best go tell Jo-Jo and meemaw!"

I knew my only way out was if I contained this information. "Don't ruin the surprise...." I said in a fatherly tone that I didn't know I was capable of, "if other people find out about my secret goings on the North Pole Police might just shut me down. And that'd be tragic." 

"Ohhh No!" She said as if she were a cartoon character witnessing the end of her universe. "I'll make sure not to tell my mommy."

"Sweet thanks," I said as I breathed a massive sigh of relief. "I'm gonna go back to hiding in the closet now." 

I went back into my closet and closed my eyes to rest for a bit. I woke up to a little girl screaming, "Bubby! Santee Clause is in our house and he says we're going to get extra presents!" 

Ohhhh fuck, I thought to myself. I heard some rustling and footsteps coming from the floor above me. A few sets of foot steps walked toward my closet and I started to sweat profusely.

* The unsuspecting little girl in the family timidly says that they should let him stay
* When the police arrive they see a happy family eating and get very confused as to why they were called
