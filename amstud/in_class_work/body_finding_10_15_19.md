### The Body

Write the dialogue and description that would appear in a piece of fiction just *before* the discovery of a body. You might perhaps describe two characters' approach to the body they will find, or the location, or both. The purpose of the exercise is to develop the technique of at once attracting the reader toward the paragraph to follow, making them want to skip ahead, and holding them on this paragraph by virtue of its interest. Without the ability to write such scintillating paragraphs, one can never achieve real suspense.  



Holding Claire's hand, I started walking into the verdant cave. I was hit by a wave of musty moisture, that had been trapped there for a long time. My skin started to feel wet as if there was sweat, but it was just the humidity of the stony place. I felt Claire's hand grip mine tighter as she started to shake. 

It's gonna be ok, I tried to assert calmly, but my voice wavered. My body tensed up as I heard a noise come from the corner. Drip. The sound echoed. Drip. It sounded like the water was hitting something other than the floor of the cave. Screeeech. I heard a skittering noise coming from the other end of the cave. I almost screamed. Drip. 

How do you know? Claire asked me. What if we end up like the rest of them? *That would be horrible*, I barely managed to keep the thought from exiting my pursed lips, that I could feel the blood draining from. A fate like that should never have to befall anyone, yet alone the people closest to us. Some animal or thing belted out another screech. Claire squeezed my hand for dear life, her knuckles turning white. She screamed. Do you think anyone heard Connor and Erin scream? Do you think they got the chance to scream?

I started walking toward the sound where the dripping was coming from. Drip. It started to get louder. Drip.
