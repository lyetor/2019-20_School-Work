Character - A hippie

Intention/obstacle - "get the body in the car" 



"hey man, can you pass the blunt," I mumbled. 

"sure dude. just make sure there's some left for Nate," Josh responded. 

"i'm almost passed out," Nate chimed in. He continued, "i do have a special surprise for today, though."

"oh shit, what is it?" I asked curiously. 

Nate responded after a while, "i got my hands on some acid for us." 

Josh leaned forward, "Dayum dude. Good for you."

I added, "remember the time at woodstock that we took acid during the beatles performance."

"shiiit, yea," Josh and Nate said to me at the same time. 

"those were the times," I reminisced. 

"so who wants the lsd," Nate asked in the way people 'offer' up the last cookie or slice of something. 

"i'm good man," I calmly responded while Josh shook his head next to me. 

"I guess I'll just pop all of them, like woodstock 2 years ago." Nate said foolishly. 

"but wasn't that the time that you passed out and we took you to the er," Josh worriedly asked through the haze of the weed. 

"eh. something like that, should be fine though." Nate said slowly.

"need any water to was that down?" I asked, worried. 

"nah. i do need to eat something for my munchies thooooooo," Nate said with his mouth open still making sound, "ooooo."

"uber eats?" Josh queried.

"sounds like a plan," I responded. 

"it has been ordered," Josh, the caretaker of us, responded. 

"hasn't it been like 20 minutes since you ordered it," I said in a matter of fact way.

"yea, is Nate doing okay?" Josh said.

"idk dude, he's been out for a while"

"fuuuck, that's not good"

"Can you check on him", I said in a more serious way.

"Dude. He doesn't have a pulse." Josh screamed. 

"What. The. Fuck," I yelled, "How did we not find out earlier?"

"I don't know, at Woodstock we were all a bit more sober and the sun was out", Josh said wishing we had done the same thing. 

"Well we have to take him somewhere. Right?"

"Can we just hide in the car until we're sober?" 

"I guess that would work."

"Help me move him to the backseat."

"Fuck, I can't actually get up," I said trying to fight the drug-induced haze.

"Ahhhh. I can't either dude." Josh said, "What are we going to do. We need to do something with him."

"If only we could call someone to help us move the body..." I added, "But nobody knows where we are."

Josh responded, "Dude I also can't move. It feels like I'm stuck in a stained glass painting."

"With music blaring, right?" I asked. 

"Wouldn't it be so cool if we could get up and help Nate?" Josh pondered.
