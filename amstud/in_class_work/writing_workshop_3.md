### Food Eating Workshop

Tasting notes:

* Mochi - Kyle, Naomi, Voxa
* Shrimp chips - Screaming Camerones 
* Angel cookie - Smells like honey or caremlized sugar, memories of Evergeen 



I brought the small rectangle next to my nose and inhaled, smelling the fake shrimp. I put the chip on my tongue getting a slight hint of wasabi, my mind screamed, "CHICARONNNNNNNNNN" as I unmasked the shrimp flavor that was hiding behind the spice of the wasabi. I had a memory wash over my mind, of five year old Sachin walking through a grocery store with his two best friends. Their baby sitter and her daughter wandering through the store with us together, both fluent in Spanish. I vividly remember the daughter, a couple of years older than my and my friends, seeing a bad of shrimp chips and just screaming "chicaron", shrimp in Spanish, in a shrill voice at the top of her lungs. Fading back into reality, my fingers then closed in on a soft, yellow squishy ball. Unsure what it was i brought the smell-less food to my mouth and immediately recognized it to be mochi, one of my favorite things. The floury outside contrasting the tender, flavorful inside. Almost as if it were a metaphor for those close to me who enjoyed mochi with me; people with startlingly soft and gooey insides compared to a harder exterior that was trying to assimilate. But these people, specifically Kyle and Naomi, are some of the people I've come closest to in my life. Along with this, I was reminded of the startup I work at, who's main project is an electron microscopse named Mochii. I closed my eyes and just rolled around the mango flavored dough on my tongue, as I contemplated  the process of disarming someone's barriers and getting to know them.
