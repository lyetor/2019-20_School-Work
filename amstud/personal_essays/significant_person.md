### Significant Person Personal Essay

Brainstorm/prewriting:

Before: good grades, I think writing is a systematic process (thesis, anecdotes, structured paragraphs), feeling like I have the power to control my own humanities grade 

Problem: Brian introduces this super complicated assignment that doesn't make a lick of sense, and I am flipping a coin for 25% of my grade (stress this with the 4.0 issue)



During: Having a conversion with dad (juxtapose how he taught you how to write and turned it from amorphous bullshit to something with a structure, that is scientific) and him saying that writing is an art and the world isn't black and white, meaning we have to be fine with living in gray areas



After: The world isn't as black and white as I thought, it's more gray areas. Writing is a subjective task, yes, but one that takes skill and many years of practice. It is an art-form wherein we take complicated, nuanced ideas and convey them through vivid imagery and description. Thus rather than a coin flip, Brian is testing my ability to exercise a skill that I never thought existed much less had.





Hook/Problem: (This has to be cut down) 

* Knees are weak, arms are sweaty 

*Breathe.* I'm sitting in a slightly sweat-dampened chair in my morning humanities class. I furiously scribble down notes in different colored pens, with how fast I was writing i thought my arm was sure to fall off. *Just breathe.* As sweat begins to collect on my forehead, it feels like there is a lead ball in my throat. My stomach starts tying itself into a knot making me want to throw up. *Breathe. In and out* 

Brian continued to flip through his sideshow further explaining the assignment, but none of the reassurement he gave to any of my peers did anything to assuage my anxiety. I looked down to see my hands shaking over the pages of my yellow legal pad. I heard my heart pounding in my head along with a ringing in my ears and I wished nothing more than to be able to turn those things off. As I sat there, mind blank and stomach full of ammunition for my vomit, my hands kept writing down whatever Brian said. 

There I was, a 4.0 student who had just been handed a death warrant in the form of a personal essay. I had come into the school year ready to conquer the course that claimed to be one of the hardest that SAAS had to offer. Throughout ninth and tenth grade I had endured many low-sleep nights figuring out how to properly write. My dad had taken me on a journey from believing that writing was an amorphous blob of bullshit to seeing the beauty in the structure and systematic nature of scientific and analytical writing. Walking into that classroom a mere 20 minutes ago, I was on top of the world ready to complete whatever task Brian gave by structuring my writing and following rules. Instead of giving us a challenging literary analysis essay to write, Brian had assigned us a personal essay, tantamount to flipping me off. 

"I want it to be banal and trivial, but have higher order concepts and engaging description", Brian said as if any of us thought this was a coherent sentence that we could use to aid our writing. Banal and engaging, trivial and special, concise and over-descriptive. These contradictions flew around my head as if they were being spun around by a hurricane, with the eye of the storm being my anxiety. He wanted anecdotes, but explanation at the same time. None of it made any sense, no one had a clue how to write this.

 "25% of your grade", he said. There had to be more to that sentence but that was all I could register. I felt bile building up in my throat ready to be shot at my classmate who was unfortunately sitting right across from me. I was out of control. I couldn't control my heart rate, my stomach, or even something like my amstud grade. Instead of grading my structured writing skills, my English teacher was going to flip a coin to decide my fall trimester grade. 



The actual conversation with Dad:

* What does Brian want me to do?
* Pushing back on Dad's ideas and him trying to explain that those are hitting the target



Fast Forward a couple of days: I'm sitting at the dinner table chatting with my dad. Homework assignments litter the table, each one hoping to be the next task on my list. Sadly enough for those assignments I only have one piece of school work in mind, my personal essay.  These past couple of days my personal essay had been weighing on my similar to how the world weighed down Atlas's shoulders. I thought about it when I woke up and when I went to bed. 

Whenever my dad mentioned an idea I would shoot it down as being too cliche or as unoriginal. Although I did have a heart to heart with a sports coach who was a father figure for me, I knew that ten other people in the class would already be writing about that. With my jaw starting to tighten and my hands clenching and un-clenching I was getting more and more anxious with each passing minute. "Why don't you go into the negative and talk about somebody who had an adverse effect on you?" my dad queried. *No!*, I heard someone screaming inside of my head. It was plain obvious that everyone who didn't want to go with the grain would choose to talk about someone that hurt them. He continued, "Maybe you can talk about a Starbucks barrista or a homeless guy you saw on the sidewalk." *None of this is good enough for Brian's obscene standards.* 

"Maybe you just don't get it. Dad" I responded in an exasperated tone. I couldn't quite place my finger on the thought that I was trying to articulate when I responded to my dad, but I quickly realized that I just felt that this task was impossible. I was on the verge of giving up and just bullshitting the assignment. I felt defeated, similarly to the feeling of walking into an exam hall already knowing the grade you would get walking out the door. "I may as well just give up and write about how bullshit this assignment that Brian gave us actually is", I flippantly blurted out. There wasn't even a point in trying to space out the writing over a couple of days; I resigned myself to writing some corny essay on Tuesday night full well knowing that my grade could be a 4.0 or a 2.3. 

My dad walked to the kitchen but kept watching me. He could probably see my muscles all tensed up and an exhausted look on my face. "Just give it a break, the idea will come to you when it does," he tried to reassure me. *Yea, right. Not a chance in hell that an actual idea will ever surface.* I didn't take his queue and tried to wrap my head around the sheer magnitude of this writing assignment. My brain started to pound and screamed out for help. It viscerally hurt my stomach trying to force creativity. 



Sitting at the dinner table, alone:

* Me starting to understand that writing is this art form that transforms complicated, nuanced points into easier things to understand 

As he left to go downstairs my dad gave me a hug and wished me luck, two things he does sparingly. This left me alone at the table to sit with the ideas that sat in my brain as cluttered as my homework assignments on our unorganized dining table. *Why was my dad patronizing?* He was never the type to say that art or creativity took time. My dad was a scientist deep to his core, yet he wanted me, an engineering kid, to take the time and let my brain arrive on an idea by itself.

I sat their wondering what point I was even trying to make in my essay. Was I trying to critique the actions by which someone had hurt me or did I want to praise a person who helped lift me up and change my perspective. With my head spinning in circles with countless doors whizzing by I had no idea which one to step into. I was at a complete loss for what was going on in my head. I simultaneously felt completely empty and like I had ideas bursting forth in my head. 

I took a moment to step back and recognize this feeling that I was having. Maybe this was the goal of the assignment. To make me feel the sweat on my back and fingertips. To force me to think in uncertain, gray areas. I was still stuck on what to write about, but I had finally started to feel that I had an idea of what was going on. I might get a B-, but at least I thought hard. *Right?* Here I sat with a problem, I still didn't know how to write the essay. *Hadn't Brian mentioned something about a problem that needs to be fixed?* 

I start to realize that maybe these contradictions that I saw actually go hand in hand. Words start to fly around my head: nuance, beauty, art, empathy. Maybe Brian wasn't crazy after all. Maybe I could actually exercise the skill of art in creating my essay. Maybe I could actually conquer that seemingly out of reach A on the essay. My idea then hits me like a brick, there was my epiphany that I just needed patience for. I quickly pull out my dell laptop, open up a blank document, and slowly type the first word: "*Breathe*".
