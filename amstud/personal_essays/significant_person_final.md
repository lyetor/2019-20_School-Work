Scene 1:

I squeezed my hand into my jeans pocket grabbing for my phone. As I tried to pull it out of my pants it slipped out of my sweat-greased fingers. I tried to dry the sweat off my hands by rubbing them against the dry denim for the second time that minute. I finally got my phone out on the third try. My thumbs continued to shake making the nagivation through my phone exponentially harder. I opened up my text chain with my dad and the screen instantly filled with green and gray text bubbles of varying size. Some were angy, some were kind, but most all of them came from a place of love. As I started drafting my text in my head, I considered tapping on his little contact icon and calling him, but I could barely hear the person next to me over the din of the Upper Stream Commons. 

After electing to text him, my sweaty thumbs started to slide over the slick glass screen in an effort to convey my predicament to him. As I recalled the events earlier in the day that I was trying to recount to my father, I spaced out and thought back to something Brin had said in the English classroom. "I want it to be banal and trivial, but have higher order concepts and engaging description", Brian said. Banal and engaging, trivial and special, concise and over-descriptive. These contradictions swirled around my head, sucked with hurricane-force towards the ball of anxiety sitting in the eye of the storm. Finally managnig to stop my thumbs from shaking, I started to type out my message to my dad: *Brian just assigned us a personal essay and I have no idea what to do. And he said it's worth 25% of our grade!* I set my phone down and awaited a response.

*It'll be okay.* The first message said, as if he knew me well enough to understand how much anxiety I was feeling. He follwed that up with asking me what the prompt on the essay was. After sitting there with the texts open for a couple minutes, he wrote *Rembember, it's not the grade that matters, but the learning you did to get through it.* "Why does he always put periods after his texts?" I muttered to myself. Although he said the right thing nine times out of ten, I still didn't believe what he said about the grades not mattering. I knew deep down that he wanted me to get a 4.0 at the end of the day, and that it was my job to make it happen. 

I started to explain my predicament to him. While I texted certain words jumped out at me: personal narrative, descriptive, unique, and a couple more. I began to relive the anxiety I experienced when Brian outlined the essay for us. As my breath started to pick up, my friend reminded me to try and take deaper breaths. I proof read the text to make sure it outlined what I was trying to say, and pressed the little green arrow. After setting my phone down next to me, I proceeded to put my face in my hands and feel the flow of salty tears down my face. 





Scene 2:



- Talking with dad about the essay 
- Still feeling mega stressed about this
- Dad tells me that it's going to be okay and he reminds me of 
- Change status:
  - This is where the change happens
  - Reminds me of how he helped me work through it last time

I heard our downstairs door unlock bringing me out of my depression and anxiety induced slumber. "Sachin, you home?" my fathers bellowed, filling the house with sound. I felt overwhelemd by a sense of ennui at the thought of attempting to do any work. Flexing my core, I tried to respond but my shortness of breath and general malaise meant instead of giving my dad a response I just gasped. I again tried to engage my abs, but this time in a futile effort to get up. The simeltanous feelings of my heart racing from anxiety and monotnous depression did nothing to help me write my essay. 

Completely unexpectedly, my dad came into my room. He leaned all of his 180 pounds on my door frame, and asked me what was wrong. I tried to explain my predicimant but my words came out an incoherrent flow that left him more confused. Whispering some words and saying others my dad got a jumble of words, "Stupid...25%...Stress...Useless..Impossible!" As I spoke more, I got angrier and angrier. I felt fire in my chest as I looked at the wall perpinduclar to my bed as my head lay on the pillow. 

"So what can I do in this situation to help you?" he queried. My dad then followed this up by reminding me of last year, "remember when Brian assigned the what does war do paper? We got through that just fine, didn't we?" 

"Like, I guess. But it's not the same," I complained in the voice of a whiny child who got his favorite toy taken away. 

My dads face telegraphed a look of confusion and general worry, "I feel like that's what you said last time. And the time before that. And it always ends up working out."

This had never been said aloud, but there existed an implicit understanding between the both of us that grades were more important than most all else. Similar to an understanding I assume he had my grandfather. And my grandfather with his father, and so on. "But, like, what if I fail?" I said come extremely close to a wail. I continued, "I just don't think you get it, Dad." Tacking on the second part as if it were the worst insult I could've said. 

"Dude I get it more than you could ever know," he said trying to dumb down his voice in the way an old camp counseler talks to a kid 20 years younger than himself. This response triggered a memory in my brain, about sitting in a Turkish restaraunt hearing about my dad's childhood. One plagued with erratic behavior, sub-par grades, and enough adult-child yelling for more than a couple lifetimes. My dad responded as if he could actually read my mind, "remember all those stories I told you when we were having dinner at that one mediteranian place."

"Yeah, I guess." I muttered apathetially just loud enough for him to hear. No matter what I said this essay wasn't going to make sense so I just decided to get out of a conversation that was futiley chasing a grade I was never going to get, "I'm gonna go to the bathroom now." 



Scene 3:

- Working on the essay in my room
- Feeling good about how the essay is going
- Dad offers to make me tea and I feel supported
- See his name open up on the document and that pushes me other the edge to start writing and I feel very confident in what I'm doing
- Change status:
  - Change has happened
  - Dad has alleviated my stress and pain by talking to me and holding my hand while I do it

I sat in my blue and white synthetic leather chair and opened my laptop. The bright light of the dell startup screen hurt contrasted the grey morning that was developing outside. I moved my mouse cursor to chrome and stared at the blank document that represented a large portion of my grade for the term. I cracked my fingers trying to do anything that would delay my working on the assignment. Ready to close my laptop and go back to sleep, I took a deep breath in the hopes that something would come to me. I looked up relaxing my neck muscles and just spun around in my chair. 

I heard some shuffling going on in the hallway outside my room and assumed it was my dad getting an early start to the day, something he had taught me to do. I always felt as if I wrote best in the morning, but even that trick wasn't helping me. The noise from my dad slowly subsided as he sat down to get working. I assumed he had sat down to work on emails or prepare for the classes he was teaching that day.

I saw a little icon show up on the top of my google docs screen. It was a small picture of my dad. Shortly after that, I saw a comment on the document that said *Do you want tea or coffee?* I couldn't help stop the edges of my lips from curling up into a smile. As I thought about my dad, I pictured a small Indian kid waking up early to handwrite an essay with his mom sitting next to him with a cup of tea. The blood in my veins felt like it pumped a bit stronger and my eyes opened as they after the first sip of a coffee. I imagined my grandmother editing my dad's essay and waking up early just to be there with him.

With that image in my mind, I put my fingers on the black keys and started to type. As I got into the flow, my hands flying across the keyboard I remembered waking up early to complete my *What Does War do?* paper about a year ago. With my dad sitting on the document, this essay felt just like every other one I had written with him at my side. The reservoir of ideas in my head flowed on to the page like a river raging to the ocean. As I wrote tranquilly, I kept the image of my dad as a child close to my heart, and tucked the memory of the past few days in a nook in my head, ready to tell it to my child when he needs it.
