Hook:

Feet sore and mind hurting, Rajesh trudged through his home's doorway utterly exhausted. His stomach tied itself into a knot as soon as he smelled the garam masala that his mom cooked with every night. Right when the smelled filled his nostrils he heard a shrill screech that he'd become accustomed to after hearing it his whole life, "Rajeeesh!" his mom bellowed. Rajesh had come to learn that this screech was always accompanied by a lot of yelling or a simple ass beating. 

Walking into the dining room, already knowing where his parents were sitting, his skin crawled. He had a ball in his throat that wouldn't let him speak. As soon as he made eye contact with his father, Rajesh felt a visceral need to throw up. "Why are you home so late? How was school? Why aren't your grades good enough? Did you win the soccer game?" his dad grilled him. These questions had become hackneyed in the Jaffrey household and became tantamount to a fly landing on one's arm. 

With his stomach knotted from homework anxiety, Rajesh curtly responded, "To hell with you. I'm going to my room." He very rarely played this card, but today was just too much. Rajesh's head spun in circles with thoughts coming from all directions. The stairs echoed the sound of his feet stomping on the smooth bamboo. His parents heard the sound of wood hitting wood as Rajesh slammed his door shut. He half jumped half fell onto his bed and felt wet beads flowing down his face as he accidentally drifted off into the blackness.
