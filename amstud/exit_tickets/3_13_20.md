What's an example of a "good relationship" you've seen in *Their Eyes Were Watching God* thus far?



An example of a good relationship in TEWWG is the friendship between Janie and Phoeby. Not plagued with the issue's of a parent-child relationship, these two are able to let their friendship blossom because they are on equal footing. On page 7 Phoeby comforts Janie for losing Tea Cake and wants to understand what happened rather than using the grandma's fix-it mentality. On page 10, we see that Phoeby's active listening and emotional presence helped coax Janie into telling a story that was not very easy to tell. I think the ability to have this emotionally mature relationship where both parties are able is somewhat unique to the friendship. If this was a parent-child relationship then the parent would have a responsibility to help the child and utilize a fix-it mentality. The fact that they are on equal footing means that a power imbalance doesn't let the care for each other manifest in abusive ways.
