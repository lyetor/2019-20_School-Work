### Tuesday Exit Ticket

As we head into our final big history unit on the Civil War, is there anything in particular you're curious about or interested in learning?  No guarantees that I can cover it all, but I'd like to get a picture of what you're interested in!

As I asked in class today, I would be super interested in learning more about the Asian immigrant population in America. I'm also pretty sure we're going to touch on this later, but I think discussing the evolution of political parties and ideology would be pretty cool. The quick Q&A session after a history lecture was really nice and I'd love to do that more. Also, like Shiah said, I think reading primary documents and discussing them in class in context could be interesting. I also would like to learn more about post civil war America, specifically in the context of our book. 

Upload by the end of class!
