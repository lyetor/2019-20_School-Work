### The Story of Bottled Water Reflection 

**Question #1** - What was the point of the video?  What was the narrator trying to get across to the audience?

* Bottle water is more expensive, usually not as cleaner, and tastes worse 
* Bottled water is 2000x more (US buys 500mil bottles of water every week)
* **Manufactured demand** 
  * Companies have to sell more in order to grow more
  * Circa 1970s soda companies are worried because they are projected to have a downtick in sales/growth 
  * So they create a new invention which seemed like a silly fad at the time, bottled water
* Bottled water companies try to paint tap water as something gross and dirty that nobody would want to buy
* Uses picture of pristine nature, but often times they use tap water
* Hearkens back to the info-graphic of waste 
* The amount of petroleum used in the creation of plastic is enough to fuel a million cars
* Then there is the transportation cost of shipping it around the planet
* All of that goes to a bottle of water being drunk on average in about 2 minutes
* Post-drinking, the bottles usually go to land fills or are burned in incinerators that release toxins (These usually statements are really rubbing my the wrong way, this seems like an easy way to blow numbers out of proportion)
* Rather than recycling bottles to make new bottles, the companies do something called downcycling where they turn the empty bottles into lower grade plastic products which are eventually thrown away
* Need to beat out the competition, which in this case is tap water
* In some places the water is actually polluted, but it's by companies like the plastic bottle companies (This like here coupled with the info-graphic makes it seem pretty unreliable imho) 
* Solution:
  * Don't buy bottled water
  * Join orgs that are trying to put funding towards better tap water infrastructure
  * Around the world 1 billion people don't have access to tap water
  * Root cause is polluting that makes tap water bad 
* Synonymous with smoking while pregnant

**Question #2** - How does the video relate to sustainability and to systems?  You've already learned about the three E's (environment, economics, and equity) and the three P's (planet, profits, and people) as well as about complex systems.  Did the video address these topics?  If so, how?

* This video is essentially an example of a product that goes through the linear system that is outlined in the story of stuff
* It talks about the industry of bottled water as it passes through a system with the lens of planet, profits, and people or the three Es if you like
  * Walks through both the economics to the producer and the consumer of bottled water
  * Vaguely talks about the impacts on people
  * Stresses the impact that bottled water has on the environment, but doesn't provide a lot of statistics   

**Question #3** - In class, we encourage you to ask a couple of questions before saying something in class; Is it true?  Is it kind?  Does it get us further down the road to knwoedge (or understanding)?  Did they use "I" statements?  Give us a critique of how the narrator did in following our rules.  Where did they succeed and where did they fail?

* I saw quite a few flaws in the production of the video that made me question how credible of a source this actually is:
  * Rather than using a lot of I statements, she uses a lot of We statements which I would argue fall in the same category as you/they statements of overarching generalizations about another set of people
  * She uses phrases such as "usually" and "like" that can blow small statistics completely out of proportion and leave the listener with a completely skewed sense of what is happening 
  * While I understand that the format that she is working in is meant to be very accessible and not dense, I think her lack of statistics/numbers really takes away from the credibility of the video. She skirts around this by using anecdotes and saying things confidently with cute images to make the watcher think that she is completely right
  * I also don't see any place where she cites her sources, sure I could dig around through her website to find where the citations are, or she can pretty feasibly attribute her information 'in-text' by saying "According to so and so, such and such is true"
* All of these fall under the category of things we can avoid, but at the same time I can understand why she uses these tactics given the presentation medium she's using and what I assume to be her target audience
